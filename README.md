## Aspiring front-end developer

Since 2018, I have been working in a software company but just in the support team, in my last position I had to learn a bit of SQL, the command line and git. Since 2020 when the pandemic hit, I had some free time on my own, so decided to give it a try to HTML, CSS and JS. Eventhought a left it at first, in 2021 I came back and Im enjoying it.  

Happy Coding!
